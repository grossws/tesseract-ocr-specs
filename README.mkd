# Description

This repo contains rpm spec-files to build [Tesseract OCR][tesseract] engine and [Leptonica][leptonica].

Actual versions are: `leptonica 1.69` and `tesseract 3.02`.

# Building

Build process is tested on CentOS 6.4. To study RPM building and specs writting see [Fedora wiki][fedora-build].

## Prepare build environment (for CentOS 6)

Install base and development tools (or only development tools if you have not a miniman CentOS installation):

```bash
yum groupinstall 'Base' 'Development Tools'
yum install rpmdevtools rpmlint createrepo
```

Create non-privileged user to build RPMs and setup build environment:

```bash
/usr/sbin/useradd --gid users --create-home makerpm
passwd makerpm

su - makerpm
rpmdev-setuptree
```

## Actual build

Log in as `makerpm`, download source files, install build dependencies and build package itself:

```bash
su - makerpm

curl https://raw.github.com/grossws/tesseract-ocr-specs/master/utils/download-sources.sh | bash

yum-builddep leptonica.spec
rpmbuild -ba leptonica.spec
```

Then install built `leptonica-devel` and build `tesseract` with its langpacks:

```bash
sudo yum install $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/$(uname -m)/leptonica{,-devel}-1.69-*.rpm

yum-builddep tesseract.spec
rpmbuild -ba tesseract.spec

sudo yum install $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/$(uname -m)/tesseract{,-devel}-3.02-*.rpm
rpmbuild -ba tesseract-langpack.spec
```

Now you have all RPMs in `$HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/$(uname -m)/`.
